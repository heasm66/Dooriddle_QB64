These 9 adventures was originally designed by John H. Doolittle and the first 6 written for Apple IIe  by Eric Thornton in, most probably, ZBasic. 
These were released commercially by *Critical Thinking Press* in two compilations; **Hangtown Triology** (*Hangtown*, *Farmtown* and *Pirate Island*) and
**Adventures in Danger!** (*Cave of the Troll*, *Townhouse Adventure* and *Cursed Castle*). The last three games (*Toyland*, *Uptown* and *Boardwalk*) 
were never commercial released.

At some point in time, the games were ported to Borlandâ€™s Turbo BASIC for IBM-compatible PCs and continued to have occasional updates until 1996.
  
Here are the Turbo BASIC-files tweaked and bugfixed to run in [QB64](https://qb64.com/), a Basic-version that compiles to both Windows, Linux and Macintosh.

The chronologically order of the games are:
  1. *Hangtown*
  2. *Farmtown*
  3. *Pirate Island*
  4. *Cave of the Troll*
  5. *Townhouse Adventure* (also called *Midnight Emergency* or *Babysitting*)
  6. *Cursed Castle*
  7. *Toyland*
  8. *Uptown*
  9. *Boardwalk*
